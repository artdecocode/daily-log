### 21 Friday: IdioCore

Today there was more effort on making Macros available in _Documentary_, and then documenting and refactoring middleware setup logic in the `@idio/core`. Macros worked well together, and I added some logos to each middleware.

```

In the end, I tried to record an [_Appshot_](https://github.com/artdecocode/appshot) of the _VS Code_ when creating a server using _IdioCore_. I used [_Aty_](https://github.com/artdecocode/aty) to type commands automatically, however when combined with a recording, the program would lag and result in a delay, which made the whole recording impossible. In the end, I just had to do it by hand. This means that there needs to be another way to record examples of developer experience, e.g., by creating a _VS Code_ plugin. It could then also record SVGs rather than gifs.

**FUTURE**
- [ ] Write a plugin for _VS Code_ for automatic typing of code, with delays and short-keys such as to expand hints.
- [ ] Improve _Appshot_ to have a web interface, with visual selection of windows, and selecting the cropping area of the window.
- [ ] Display an error in the `window-info` package, such as when Python does not have `Quartz` library installed.
