- [x] dec 7 [Building Minimal Authorized Kinaba Image Oneself For Peace Of Mind in 2 Steps.](https://medium.com/@art_deco/building-minimal-authorized-kinaba-image-oneself-for-peace-of-mind-in-2-steps-1d2f1497b95a)

The more articles to write are:

- [ ] Compiling the script that has foreign dependencies in Closure Compiler.

The 2 keys on the keyboard broke, the left `ctrl` and `option`. The day I lost control. I think this is because I slept on them, and now they refuse to be back. But I swear I pressed cmd-option-save on the left by the habit once (i've to use the right option now) and it worked (saved all files)! maybe it's not the lost case and the glitch of the macintosh. The new os is 10.14 because one can't always stay on 10.10 or something. It was not possible before and the OS would not run on macbooks older than 2012 but smart kind people updated the drives and made it possible. I even didn't have to burn any CDs -- because I have 2 hard drives, I mounted the image on one of them, and booted from it.
