Viva la [`SVaG`](https://svag.io)! As continuation from yesterday's work on making a terminal SVG, I started the day by figuring out that the best course of action would be to create a package which would export multiple UI elements as SVGs. The elements can be dynamically generated, therefore a whole library was written. In the beginning, I just worked on the `svag` package and was putting lib methods and UI elements such as `terminal` in there, but quickly changed to registering a new organisation on `npm` [`svag`](https://www.npmjs.com/org/svag) and on GitHub, and used `mnp` to spawn packages.

The GitHub org name `svag` was taken, and the request to free it due to inactivity was denied as there was some private activity. I also got a 2-month old response saying that `artdeco` org is also not inactive, but I could try the trademark claim. Therefore, the org `svagjs` was registered although I'm not a big fan of adding `js` at the end because it's so easy, unless it's something like `mnpjs` because npm also uses `npmjs.com` and `mnp` is a play on `npm`.

After a while, I checked the domain names for `svag` and most of them were free, with `svag.net` and `svag.org` being for sale. The `svag.co` sounded really cool, despite the price for $130 for a premium name, therefore it was acquired, as `.co` domains are super nice. `Svag LTD` is not available to register as a company.

```js
Domain    Available  Premium  Price
svag.com     no
svag.net     no
svag.org     no
svag.biz     yes
svag.co      no         âœ“     130.00
svag.cc      yes
svag.io      yes
svag.bz      yes
svag.nu      yes
svag.app     yes
```

Then I focused the efforts on implementing the library with some methods such as creating rounded corners in an SVG path and others, adding tests and documentation. Slowly progressed in order `lib` -> `toolbar`, `shadow` -> `window`. The `shadow` was initially called blur because it's the main filter used in it, but I didn't notice almost till the end. The `window` was also called `terminal` but it's just a generic `window`. Moreover, had to go back to `ansi-to-svg` to update the interface, and fixed the foreground/background bug from yesterday.

Trying to use `I` in the log, although it does sound more personal, but I'm not gonna write `we` because it's too formal.

There's an [`asciinema`](https://asciinema.org/) project which allows to play terminals as `svg` animations, however the purpose of `SVaG` is to provide dynamic UI elements.

**FUTURE**

1. Implement the terminal output into the simple window.
1. Animate the terminal output.
1. Embed `@svag/window` into documentary when the terminal is ready  (possibly as a plugin rather than dependency?), because waiting on `ansi-to-svg` to merge the PR can last forever, and we want our own package to do that, it's not difficult.
1. move the `clean-stack` to art deco scope as still waiting on the PR to get merged.

1. Timer: (10.5 - 5.3 = 5.2) + (7.28) = _12 hours 30 min_
