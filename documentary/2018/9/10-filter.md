When checking out the repository on the phone using mobile Safari, the image did not look sharp, because the filter made it into a raster and the quality was lost.

(add screenshot here)

There were a number of solutions that were thought about and tried out.

1. Using the CSS filter to create a shadow. The GitHub's sanitiser actually allows to have the `<style>` tag inside of the CSS. The box-shadow did not work, therefore the `filter: box-shadow()` had to be used. This worked fine on the browser, however did not work on the phone. As it turns out ([Why is filter(drop-shadow) causing my SVG to disappear in Safari?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36705323/why-is-filterdrop-shadow-causing-my-svg-to-disappear-in-safari)) there's a bug in older Safari which prevents the `-webkit-filter: drop-shadow` from working. Also interestingly, the sanitiser removes the `-moz-filter` property from the style.

    ```css
    svg {
      -webkit-filter: drop-shadow(0 22px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5));
      -moz-filter: drop-shadow(0 22px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5));
      -ms-filter: drop-shadow(0 22px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5));
      filter: drop-shadow(0 22px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5));
    }
    ```

1. Trying to emulate the gradient using the `radial-gradient`. This also does not work because the radial gradient cannot be rectangular as first thought. <br/>
   ![radial gradient](images/18-9/radial.svg)
<br/>There was a proposal ([Advanced Gradients for SVG](http://www.svgopen.org/2011/papers/18-Advanced_Gradients_for_SVG/)) by _Tavmjong Bah_ who is a developer / documenter (nice job) at Inkscape to include more complex gradients, and it looked really cool, however it never ended in the spec. Great work Tavmjong nevertheless ⭕ The article really shows how pro some people are.<br/>

<br/>Then I was considering applying a transform to the radial gradient, e.g., skewing or a matrix, however it's too complicated. Adding multiple shapes with its own gradient such as 4 circles on corners and rectangles inbetween seems complex as well, as there's no straight forward understanding as how they would look together.

1. Thinking about generating a single array of dots for the shadow, and filling with radial gradients between corners. This would make the filesize large, however is a possible solution.

1. Finally, the real solution which comes as an insight, is to only apply the shadow only to a separate element. Because the mobile browser would resize this one separately from the main window, the window would not be rasterised and would look fine. This proved to be true. 🎸

```svg
<g filter="url(#shadow)" transform="translate(55, 25)">
  <defs>
    <filter id="shadow" width="132%" height="180%" x="-16%" y="-19%">
      <feOffset dx="0" dy="25" in="SourceAlpha" result="so"/>
      <feGaussianBlur in="so" result="sb" stdDeviation="27.5"/>
      <feColorMatrix in="sb" result="sm" type="matrix" values="0 0 0 0 0   0 0 0 0 0   0 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 0.5 0"/>
      <feMerge>
        <feMergeNode in="sm"/>
        <feMergeNode in="SourceGraphic"/>
      </feMerge>
    </filter>
  </defs>
  <rect width="360" height="132" fill="white" rx="6" />
</g>
<g id="the-window">
  <!-- code for drawing the window -->
</g>
```

Time spent on the problem: ~3 hours.

**TODO**

1. Update `pedantry` to allow reverse reading of files (e.g., for this blog to start from the last day every time to show most recent items)
1. Update `pedantry` to parse the number before each file properly to prevent `11` going before `2`.
1. Update `svag` packages to use correct shadow without loosing quality.
1. Add screenshots here from the iPhone to show poor quality.
