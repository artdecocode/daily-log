When checking out the repository on the phone using mobile Safari, the image did not look sharp, because the filter made it into a raster and the quality was lost. The fix was to implement the shadow as a separate element. The problem did not arise on the desktop because images were not resized, however now with the example below it is clear that it could also have happened for larger images.

There were a number of solutions that were thought about and tried out.

1. Using the CSS filter to create a shadow. The GitHub's sanitiser actually allows to have the `<style>` tag inside of the CSS. The box-shadow did not work, therefore the `filter: box-shadow()` had to be used. This worked fine on the browser, however did not work on the phone. As it turns out ([Why is filter(drop-shadow) causing my SVG to disappear in Safari?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36705323/why-is-filterdrop-shadow-causing-my-svg-to-disappear-in-safari)) there's a bug in older Safari which prevents the `-webkit-filter: drop-shadow` from working. Also interestingly, the sanitiser removes the `-moz-filter` property from the style.

    ```css
    svg {
      -webkit-filter: drop-shadow(0 22px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5));
      -moz-filter: drop-shadow(0 22px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5));
      -ms-filter: drop-shadow(0 22px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5));
      filter: drop-shadow(0 22px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5));
    }
    ```

1. Trying to emulate the gradient using the `radial-gradient`. This also does not work because the radial gradient cannot be rectangular as first thought. <br/>
   ![radial gradient](images/18-10/radial.svg)
<br/>There was a proposal ([Advanced Gradients for SVG](http://www.svgopen.org/2011/papers/18-Advanced_Gradients_for_SVG/)) by _Tavmjong Bah_ who is a developer / documenter (nice job) at Inkscape to include more complex gradients, and it looked really cool, however it never ended in the spec. Great work Tavmjong nevertheless â­• The article really shows how pro some people are.<br/>

<br/>Then I was considering applying a transform to the radial gradient, e.g., skewing or a matrix, however it's too complicated. Adding multiple shapes with its own gradient such as 4 circles on corners and rectangles inbetween seems complex as well, as there's no straight forward understanding as how they would look together.

1. Thinking about generating a single array of dots for the shadow, and filling with radial gradients between corners. This would make the filesize large, however is a possible solution.

1. Finally, the real solution which comes as an insight, is to only apply the shadow only to a separate element. Because the mobile browser would resize this one separately from the main window, the window would not be rasterised and would look fine. This proved to be true. ðŸŽ¸

```svg
<g filter="url(#shadow)" transform="translate(55, 25)">
  <defs>
    <filter id="shadow" width="132%" height="180%" x="-16%" y="-19%">
      <feOffset dx="0" dy="25" in="SourceAlpha" result="so"/>
      <feGaussianBlur in="so" result="sb" stdDeviation="27.5"/>
      <feColorMatrix in="sb" result="sm" type="matrix" values="0 0 0 0 0   0 0 0 0 0   0 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 0.5 0"/>
      <!-- The merge is actually removed in the later version -->
      <feMerge>
        <feMergeNode in="sm"/>
        <feMergeNode in="SourceGraphic"/>
      </feMerge>
    </filter>
  </defs>
  <rect width="360" height="132" fill="white" rx="6" />
</g>
<g id="the-window">
  <!-- code for drawing the window -->
</g>
```

Time spent on the problem: ~3 hours.

**TODO**

1. Update `pedantry` to allow reverse reading of files (e.g., for this blog to start from the last day every time to show most recent items)
1. Update `pedantry` to parse the number before each file properly to prevent `11` going before `2`.
1. Update `svag` packages to use correct shadow without loosing quality.
1. ~~Add screenshots here from the iPhone to show poor quality.~~

<hr/>

First thing after sleep was to register the [`artd.eco`](t) domain which I absolutely love. This is one of the best things I've ever registered. Happy happy happy. I might save up $3000 and buy `artdeco.io` later since it seems to be the only available and somewhat affordable one.

The second part of the day was spent on implementing the shadow in the `@svag` org by updating the library as well as other packages. Some extra attributes could be omitted as they had a default value (e.g., gradient starting at `y=0%` and same for the line behind the toolbar, `x=0`).

The `@svag/lib` was improved in version 2 for better `makeElement` signature which would take the name of the element as the first argument as it was compulsory anyway. The `rect` element was added and its documentation copied from the MDN website, however in future this process can be automated. The `@svag/toolbar`, `@svag/shadow` and `@svag/window` were updated to use the newer version of `makeElement`, and some TODOs were fixed in them as well, such as absolute paths to the SVG files. The `@svag/shadow` was also updated to be a separate element to prevent the loss of quality of resize, and incorporated into the `@svag/window`.

The `@svag` packages can benefit from `alamode` implementing a transform to parse `xml` in the same way as `jsx` parsing works. This means that the code could be transformed into a developer friendly version, e.g., instead of writing

```js
const rect = makeElement('rect', {
  width: 10,
  height: 20,
})
```

it would be possible to write

```jsx
const rect = <rect width={10} height={20}/>
```

which would be absolutely amazing if done with `alamode` (it was one of the goals of the regex transpiler project from the beginning). The source maps could be hard to implement but we love challenges.

The shadow was implemented, and even improved by removing merging it with the window element, so that the window which produces the shadow is transparent and only the shadow is visible. This ensures that it looks very clear on the mobiles.

There is a domain zone `.sucks`. This would be suitable for [`npm.sucks`](t) because for some reason they don't support relative urls on the `@svag` packages. Initially I thought it was the case due to trying to embed SVGs but it also does not work with PNGs. This could be because the org was named `svagjs` before, however I'm not sure. +1 in the list of things why `npm` sucks. The domains are expensive however, ~$260.

**[`git.sucks`](t)** After implementing the shadow, I was so exhausted by all the chore jobs that I had to do such as linking the scoped packages so that they can interact together, building them when needed, documenting and building documentation, reverting commits when things went wrong, running `build` and `test-build` before releasing multiple times, unlinking packages, installing new versions so that they can be tested, writing changelog messages _etc_. I realised I use `git` command to much, and instead of coding have to deal with all the unnecessary manual work. What I really want to do is:

1. Code
1. Test
1. Document

The mostly `build` and `commit` phase should be taken out of the process completely. There should be a new branch for a feature in each of the relevant packages, which would get updated w/ build and doc automatically, and then merged when everything is ready in other packages, which would then unlink the package and install it from the NPM to test against the published version. I produce a lot of commits and my motto is `commits are free` because it doesn't really matter how many commits there are. But also, if it doesn't matter, there should be no reason why I couldn't do with a single commit for a feature. Or there could be at least multiple commits for different parts of the code, but there should not be manual commits for any of the `build` jobs, be it the code or documentation. I think `moderne` is the package which could do it, however it's not just the question of using a package, but of organisation of work and habits, therefore I'm still trying to come up with requirements. Some of them are:

1. Define a group of packages, e.g., `@svag/window`, `@svag/lib`, _etc_.
1. Create a git branch for each of them when working on a new feature.
1. Link the packages together.
1. Monitor changes to the code, build and run tests against build. Also build documentation.
1. Keep pushing to GitHub whenever new code is ready. There should be no manual git push and the `git` command should be forgotten.
1. Possibly there should be a plugin for VS Code which would show the status of the group, however this can be done in the CLI as well.
1. Possibly a GUI interface to prepare a merge and publish, with a changelog message, however this could also be done in the CLI.
1. Unlinking packages and installing published versions, taking them off the stack one by one.

[`git.live`](t) should allow to focus on actual coding and not writing commit messages and force pushing to the remote. It's really tiring. The problem is probably met by other developers as well, and it could be a great tool to make. `documentary` is actually somewhat solving it for documentation by allowing to reset commits and push new versions automatically, however there's still no support for updating examples and including them in commits. `moderne` would then extend this logic to the `build` folder as well, although this could be done with `alamode --watch`.

The daily log could get its own domain, such as [`dailylog.co`](t). Gosh I love domains, especially `.co`.

**FUTURE**

- Add the `xml` parsing in ALaMode via `jsx` module loader.
- Implement the watch mode in `alamode`.
- Watch and auto-commit changes to examples in `documentary`.
