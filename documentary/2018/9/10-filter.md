When checking out the repository on the phone using mobile Safari, the image did not look sharp, because the filter made it into a raster and the quality was lost.

(add screenshot here)

There were a number of solutions that were thought about and tried out.

1. Using the CSS filter to create a shadow. The GitHub's sanitiser actually allows to have the `<style>` tag inside of the CSS. The box-shadow did not work, therefore the `filter: box-shadow()` had to be used. This worked fine on the browser, however did not work on the phone. As it turns out ([Why is filter(drop-shadow) causing my SVG to disappear in Safari?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36705323/why-is-filterdrop-shadow-causing-my-svg-to-disappear-in-safari)) there's a bug in older Safari which prevents the `-webkit-filter: drop-shadow` from working. Also interestingly, the sanitiser removes the `-moz-filter` property from the style.

    ```css
    svg {
      -webkit-filter: drop-shadow(0 22px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5));
      -moz-filter: drop-shadow(0 22px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5));
      -ms-filter: drop-shadow(0 22px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5));
      filter: drop-shadow(0 22px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5));
    }
    ```

1. Trying to emulate the gradient using the `radial-gradient`. This also does not work because the radial gradient cannot be rectangular as first thought. <br/>
   ![radial gradient](images/18-9/radial.svg)
<br/>There was a proposal ([Advanced Gradients for SVG](http://www.svgopen.org/2011/papers/18-Advanced_Gradients_for_SVG/)) by _Tavmjong Bah_ who is a developer / documenter (nice job) at Inkscape to include more complex gradients, and it looked really cool, however it never ended in the spec. Great work Tavmjong nevertheless â­• The article really shows how pro some people are.<br/>

<br/>Then I was considering applying a transform to the radial gradient, e.g., skewing or a matrix, however it's too complicated. Adding multiple shapes with its own gradient such as 4 circles on corners and rectangles inbetween seems complex as well, as there's no straight forward understanding as how they would look together.

1. Thinking about generating a single array of dots for the shadow, and filling with radial gradients between corners. This would make the filesize large, however is a possible solution.

1. Finally, the real solution which comes as an insight, is to only apply the shadow only to a separate element. Because the mobile browser would resize this one separately from the main window, the window would not be rasterised and would look fine. This proved to be true. ðŸŽ¸

```svg
<g filter="url(#shadow)" transform="translate(55, 25)">
  <defs>
    <filter id="shadow" width="132%" height="180%" x="-16%" y="-19%">
      <feOffset dx="0" dy="25" in="SourceAlpha" result="so"/>
      <feGaussianBlur in="so" result="sb" stdDeviation="27.5"/>
      <feColorMatrix in="sb" result="sm" type="matrix" values="0 0 0 0 0   0 0 0 0 0   0 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 0.5 0"/>
      <feMerge>
        <feMergeNode in="sm"/>
        <feMergeNode in="SourceGraphic"/>
      </feMerge>
    </filter>
  </defs>
  <rect width="360" height="132" fill="white" rx="6" />
</g>
<g id="the-window">
  <!-- code for drawing the window -->
</g>
```

Time spent on the problem: ~3 hours.

**TODO**

1. Update `pedantry` to allow reverse reading of files (e.g., for this blog to start from the last day every time to show most recent items)
1. Update `pedantry` to parse the number before each file properly to prevent `11` going before `2`.
1. Update `svag` packages to use correct shadow without loosing quality.
1. Add screenshots here from the iPhone to show poor quality.
