### 30 Tuesday

Today, I have updated the MacOS to version 10.14 because otherwise the `func` binaries from Microsoft needed to debug, test and deploy extensions to the Azure don't work. I didn't update for a long time but it is great to see that the laptop which is almost 10 years old works just fine, and it is really the only thing I need for work, without any new expensive gadgets. The new dark theme UI looks good although the non-dark theme is not supported as much.

Programmaticaly, I refactored `splendid` so that it is easier to understand and configure (pages configuration is now separate from the app configuration and can be written with `export` keywords).

Finally, I was able to set-up an ElasticSearch instance running on a Windows machine on Azure and install the metricbeats to send data from another VM to the first one. The data contains metrics data such as server load, and it achieve the long-standing want to run 2 VMs with Dokku apps on one and the ES on another.

**TODO**

- [ ] Write a tutorial explaining the benefits of 1-year free Azure subscription, Dokku and ElasticSearch, and how to make such a setup.
- [ ] Migrate the Windows server to the Dokku net so that it is private.
- [ ] Set up an Nginx proxy for Kibana.
- [ ] Send the log data from Nginx to ElasticSearch also.
