## October

The plan for this month is:

1. In the first week, complete the missing features for _NodeTools_, pull up the missing bits in functionality and documentation and some minor bugs (e.g., finish updating expensive, section breaks changing); work on the `mnpjs.org` to analyse packages; create a website `nodetools.co` with bare content, outline the roadmap to version two;
1. Then without timing, promote _NodeTools_ by getting in contact with multiple blogs / websites to ask them to write articles about it; write tutorials, content for the website.
1. Focus on research, prototyping, a video and pitch for _Demimonde_.
