### 12 Monday

Today I have updated the Windows virtual machine to have 2 GB of memory on a paid plan (£15/month) to be able to run _ElasticSearch_ smoothly. The performance of the machine shown by its responsiveness has improved. I also downloaded Kibana as a snapshot build locally. I tried to get its source code however it occupies a lot of disk space and cannot be sparsely downloaded (i.e., just the source folder that I wanted to compile with ÀLaMode instead of Babel). The `sparse.page` lambda function will allow to select git folders to download from GitHub. Moreover, Kibana's source contains _TypeScript_ code that also needs to be transpiled. I feel more confident now knowing how Kibana is developed and built.

In addition, I fixed a bug in the `@rqt/aqt` package where a dependency was missing, but did not show as such because it was installed as a dev dependency.
